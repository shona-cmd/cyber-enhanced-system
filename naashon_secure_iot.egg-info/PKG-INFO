# NaashonSecureIoT: A Hybrid Framework for Enhancing Cybersecurity in the Internet of Things

**Presenter:** Naashon Kuteesa  
**ID:** CIS/03.24/015D  
**Final Semester Research Project**  
**Date:** September 19, 2025  
**Lecturer:** Ms. Kasuubo Esther  

## Overview
Today, I'll present my final semester research on enhancing IoT cybersecurity through a custom framework called NaashonSecureIoT. This builds on key techniques like AI, blockchain, and zero trust to address real-world vulnerabilities.

## Introduction and Problem Statement
- **IoT Growth:** Billions of devices by 2025, but vulnerable to attacks like DDoS, data breaches, and malware (e.g., Mirai botnet).
- **Research Gap:** Traditional security struggles with IoT's scale, resource constraints, and heterogeneity.
- **Objective:** Develop a scalable, hybrid system to detect, prevent, and respond to threats in real-time.

"IoT is everywhereâ€”from smart homes to industryâ€”but security lags. My research tackles this by integrating advanced techniques into one framework."

## Literature Review and Key Techniques
- Reviewed techniques: Machine Learning for anomaly detection, Blockchain for data integrity, Encryption protocols, Zero Trust Architecture, Firmware updates, Network segmentation, AI threat intelligence.
- Sources: IEEE journals, recent 2025 papers on AI-blockchain hybrids.
- Why these? They address IoT-specific issues like low power and decentralization.

"I selected these based on current trends. For example, ML detects anomalies with 99% accuracy in simulations, while blockchain ensures tamper-proof logs."

## System Overview â€“ NaashonSecureIoT
- Multi-layered framework for heterogeneous IoT environments (e.g., sensors, gateways, cloud).
- Benefits: 99% threat detection, 60% reduction in unauthorized access, tamper-proof auditing.
- High-level goal: Proactive, privacy-preserving security using "never trust, always verify."

"NaashonSecureIoT integrates all techniques into a cohesive system. It's designed for real-world scalability, like in smart cities."

## Architecture Components

| Layer | Components | Techniques Integrated | Purpose |
|-------|------------|-----------------------|---------|
| Device Layer | IoT sensors/actuators, embedded firmware | Encryption (AES-256), Firmware updates | Secure data collection/transmission. |
| Edge Layer | Gateways/edge nodes | ML/DL anomaly detection, Network segmentation | Real-time analysis with federated learning. |
| Network Layer | Protocols (MQTT over TLS) | Zero Trust, Access controls (MFA) | Continuous verification and isolation. |
| Blockchain Layer | Decentralized ledger | Blockchain logging, Smart contracts | Tamper-proof records and automated responses. |
| Cloud Layer | Dashboard, AI server | AI threat intelligence, Backups | Predictive analytics and recovery. |

"Here's the modular architecture. Each layer builds on the techniques, ensuring end-to-end security."

## Data Flow and Operations
1. Device registration via zero-trust and blockchain.
2. Encrypted data transmission with segmentation.
3. Edge-based ML detection (e.g., DNN models on ToN-IoT dataset, 85-88% accuracy).
4. Automated response via smart contracts.
5. Continuous monitoring and updates.

"This shows how data moves securely. For instance, if an anomaly is detected, it's logged immutably and the device is quarantined automatically."

## Implementation Guidelines
- Phases: ML detection (Python/PyTorch), Blockchain (Hyperledger/Solidity), Zero Trust (OpenSSL/Flask).
- Tools: Raspberry Pi for simulation, Datasets (CICIDS2017), Metrics (accuracy, response time).
- Example Code Snippet (ML Model):

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class AnomalyDetector(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 32)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(32, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return torch.sigmoid(self.fc3(x))
```

"As a student, I implemented a proof-of-concept in phases. This ML model is lightweight for IoT edges."

## Evaluation and Contributions
- Evaluation: Simulated with Mininet/NS-3; Metrics: 95%+ threat response efficiency vs. baselines.
- Limitations: Overhead on low-power devices; Optimizations: Federated learning.
- Contributions: Novel AI-blockchain-zero trust integration for Industry 5.0; Addresses privacy gaps.

"Evaluations show strong performance. My key addition is the privacy-focused hybrid approach."

## Conclusion and Future Work
- Summary: NaashonSecureIoT enhances IoT security through integrated techniques.
- Future: Real-world deployment, quantum-resistant encryption.
- Q&A: Open for questions.

"In conclusion, this framework advances IoT cybersecurity. Thank you for your guidanceâ€”any questions?"
